# RHOSP: RedHat Open Stack Platform
## Introduction
These scripts are essentially used as part of an RHOSP undercloud/overcloud deployment. There is not earthly reason why they couldn't be modified to work on say, OpenIndiana or something similar. Much of the subscription stuff goes away if you use openSUSE, Debian, OI, also there would need to be some changes that would have to happen. Keep an eye open for OpenIndiana integration I may work on a project to port this under/overcloud concept into OI-Hipster.

## Script History
These scripts were originally developed by an architect and were completely flat with lowercase vars, and kind of hard to read. I took them and refactored them going through the process step by step along the way. They should work mostly. 

## Automation
I guess it is not hard to see where we could implement automation and efficiencies or where we might be able to do some docker action.
