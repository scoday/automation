# Automation
## Introduction
In this repo you should find little bits of things that may help you out. Most of this stuff would probably not work very well, but it could give you an idea to find some light at the end of the tunnel. 

## SaltStack
While working at a large enterpise in their Machine Learning Lab we had an issue with Chef. That issue was simply that Chef was taking entirely too long to deploy code to the nodes. As part of this problem we started looking at other automation tools including but not limited to Puppet and SaltStack. At the end of the day SaltStack came out in front for its elegant simplicity. 

## Puppet-Framework
This was a useful concept to build a homegrown deployment system out of nothing. With puppet on the bottom and a bunch of scripts connecting it to Jenkins we were able to create a fairly robust deployment system.
